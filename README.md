**Summary**
The purpose of the study was to quantify the effect of various factors, including drought, precipitation, CO2 emissions, forest area, and electrical energy consumption, on the vegetation cover of various regions using multiple factor regression and identify measures that humans can take to increase the vegetation cover.

- Conducted a comprehensive study on desertification, focusing on its impact on 2 billion people in drylands and potential displacement of 50 million by 2030.
- Processed over 67GB of geospatial data from sources including the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Terraclimate, employing Python and its libraries (Numpy, Cartopy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) for robust data analysis.
- Utilized multiple factor regression analysis to assess the influence of various factors like drought, precipitation, CO2 emissions, forest area, and electrical energy consumption on vegetation cover.
- Identified electrical energy consumption as the most significant factor influencing land degradation, followed by CO2 emissions and drought, using statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Developed region-specific strategies to combat desertification, underlining the importance of this work for eco-safety, biodiversity, human health, and sustainable development.
